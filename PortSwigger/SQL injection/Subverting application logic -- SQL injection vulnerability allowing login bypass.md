The application normally checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:  
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'password'`

How an attacker can login as any user without a password:  
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`  
-> use -- to remove the password check
