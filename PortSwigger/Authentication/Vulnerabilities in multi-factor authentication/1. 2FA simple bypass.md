## 2FA: two-factor authentication   
2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information.  
This could be:  
- Something you know: This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions” or a specific keystroke pattern
- Something you have: Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware token
- Something you are: This category is a little more advanced, and might include biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print   

## Lab requirement   
In this lab, you have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code.  
- Your credentials: wiener:peter   
- Victim's credentials carlos:montoya   

## Steps:  
1. When successfully log in using my credentials, the page url looks like:   
<img width="645" alt="1655883819(1)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106157137/174972847-fcee57ff-1a11-4d57-9dc4-1e22596cc269.png">   

2. When trying the victim credentials, we found the url of the page that requires the 4-digit code is:

So we change the "/login2" to "my-account", and we will skip the process of inputting 4-digit code and log in directly.
