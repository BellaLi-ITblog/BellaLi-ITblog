## Background   
You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code.   
To solve the lab, brute-force the 2FA code and access Carlos's account page.  
Victim's credentials: carlos:montoya  

## Steps
1. We input the correct victim's credentials, and tried random 4-digit code twice, and we were redirected back to the log in page. So we know we can try to input 4-digit code at most twice.  

2. In burp, choose the **Project Options** -- **Sessions** tab.  
  In the **SessionHandlingRules**, click **Add**.  
  In the **Scope** section, click **Include all URLs**.

  In the **Details** section, click **Add** -- **Run a Macro**.
  Click **Add** in Session Handling action editor.  
  Select the first GET /login, the first POST /login and the second GET /login2.

  Go back to Proxy -- HTTP history, find the second POST /login2 and open it in Intruder.

  In the lastest Burp Suite version, this section has been moved to **resource pool**.  
  1 thread = 1 max concurrent request

  It has to be set otherwise you will receive a 400 response instead of 200 and 302.  
  
  When receiving the 302 response, it is sucessful. We can right click the record to open it in the browser.
