## Theory  
Sometimes the 2FA has a flawed logic that once the user has completed the initial login step, the website assigned a cookie to the account and used the cookie to determine which account the user is trying to access.  

In this case, if an attacker changes the value of the cookie to whatever username they want to exploit when submitting the verification code, he or she will not need the victim's password to access the account by brute-forcing the verification code.  

## Lab description  
This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic mentioned above. 
- Your credentials: wiener:peter  
- Victim's username: carlos  

## Solution  
The first few steps of logging on as wiener are the same as the previous lab.  

Once we have successfully logged in, we switch to the BurpSuite and find the HTTP history that contains our login record.

Send this record to Intruder.  
To bypass the password, set the verify parameter to carlos and mark the mfa-code as the position to brute-force.  

After receving the results, find the one with a 302 response. Right click to show response in browser.
