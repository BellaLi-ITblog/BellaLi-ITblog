## Background  
This lab's password reset functionality is vulnerable. 
- The POST request contains the username.  
- The token parameters in the request are not checked.  

To solve the lab, reset Carlos's password then log in and access his "My account" page.  
- Your credentials: wiener:peter  
- Victim's username: carlos  

## Steps  

1. With Burp on, click forget the password in the browser.  

2. Input my own username and submit.  

3. Open the email inbox and click on the link provided.  

4. Reset the password.  

5. In Burp HTTP history, find the POST /forgot-password record, and it has the username in the request.

6. Send this record to Repeater, delete the value of temp-forgot-password-token and send. We can still get a 302 found response. This means the token parameters are not checked when we send the request.

7. Change the username to 'carlos' and send the request again.  

8. Back to the browser, and login using the username 'carlos' and 'new-passord-1' password.
