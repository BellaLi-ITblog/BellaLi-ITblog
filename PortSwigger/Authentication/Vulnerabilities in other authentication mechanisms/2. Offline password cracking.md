## Background:  
The lab contains an XSS vulnerability in the comment functionality.  
It stores the user's password hash in a cookie.  
To solve the lab, obtain Carlos's stay-logged-in cookie and use it to crack his password. Then, log in as carlos and delete his account from the "My account" page.  
- Your credentials: wiener:peter
- Victim's username: carlos

## Steps:  

1. With Burp running, use your own credentials to login, check the "stay logged in" box.  

2. In Burp HTTP history, find the GET /my-account.  
3. In the inspector panel, we can see the cookie is encoded from base64.

   `wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770`  
   The first part is the username, with a ':', and followed by a hash which may be the password.  

4. Use a hash crack website to crack the hash:

5. Check if the comment functionality is vulnerable.  
On the website page, insert the payload in the comment box.
