## Background  
Password change functionality can be particularly dangerous if it allows an attacker to access it directly without being logged in as the victim user.  
For example, if the username is provided in a hidden field, an attacker might be able to edit this value in the request to target arbitrary users.  
This can potentially be exploited to enumerate usernames and brute-force passwords.  
- Your credentials: wiener:peter  
- Victim's username: carlos  
- Candidate passwords list is given.  

## Steps  
1. Explore the website by logging using your own credentials. 
On the change password page:  
- Current password is correct & new password and confirm new password are the same:   
`Password changed successfully!`  
- Current password is wrong & new password and confirm new password are the same/different:   
`Current password is incorrect`  
- Current password is correct & new password and confirm new password are different:   
`New passwords do not match`  

In this case, `New passwords do not match` can be used as the indicator to if we have found the correct password.  

2. In Burp HTTP history, find the record:

3. Send it to Burp Intruder, set the current-password as payload position, enter the list of passwords as the payload set, and add a grep match rule to flag responses containing `New passwords do not match`.

4. Find the password and log in using carlos and the found password in the browser.
