This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration. It uses account locking, but this contains a logic flaw. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

## For username:
We can try to figure out the username by trying each possible username for 5 times.
To do this, we set one intruder position on username, and one empty position at the end.  
`username=§example_username§&password=example_password§§`   
Set the username payload as the list.   
Set the empty payload as **Null payloads**.   
**Cluster bomb** will be used as the attack type as it will iterate each username for five times.   
As most of the username on the list do not exist in the database, there will be a 200 OK saying _"Invalid username or password"_.   
Only the correct username, will have a longer process time than others. And it will contain a different error message saying _"You have made too many incorrect login attempts."_ (Because the limitation for trying password is 3 times, but we tried 5 times)    
And that's how we get the username.

## For password:  
Input the correct username, and set the password parameter as a payload position.   
Add the list of the password to the payload.   
**Create a grep extraction rule for the error message!**  
Start attack.   
Go through the result, find the one that is different from others.
